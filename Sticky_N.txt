We Part ways but hope we cross again
Heavy is my heart with a lot of pain
But i need to this for life is all about loss and gain
And trust me when i say, all that we have learnt together will not be in vain

No matter the darker the night is, there is always a sunrise to it
Even for a complex User story, there is a sprint end to it
So never consider a fight forfeit
After all we are QA's, wont leave without raising a defect for it.

Hoping we will meet again with Upgraded versions of ourselfs
With the same rigor and fire, pushing each other to go higher

Signing off for now but will always remain online in everyones heart beat.
Its one life, leave a mark with some feat.

We Part ways but hope we cross again...
